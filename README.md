This repository is for the dissemination of results found and desgins created for my honours thesis "Tales for Tails: Development of a Novel Biotelemetry Attachment for Australian Marsupials" (2025).

Abstract of Thesis:

"Biotelemetry tools are developing at a rapid pace with advances like battery miniaturisation and new communication protocols making devices applicable to an increasing variety of environments and species. However, the means of attaching these devices are not improving at the same pace, with collars and glue-on devices still the main techniques of attachments. For Australian marsupials, these methods may result in a rate of injury or death of upwards of 50%, leading to ecological researchers developing their own attachment styles to reduce incidence rates.
This study aims to understand ecological researcher needs for biotelemetry devices, from both human and animal perspectives, and use these requirements to develop a permanent tail-style attachment for safer performance on Australian marsupials. We do so by interviewing 3 ecological researchers on their experiences using biotelemetry devices and develop these into a list of requirements based on animal and researcher needs. These requirements, which largely focus on the wearability of such a device, are then used to guide the iterative design of a tail-style attachment. We tested this attachment on an animated mock tail and found that the device stays on the tail for an extended period and meets most of the requirements originally developed, as evaluated by both the research team and the original researchers interviewed. 
This project develops a successful tail-style attachment for biotelemetry devices yet also suggests that engagement between the ecological and engineering research communities would improve outcomes for both parties and accelerate the rate of technology adoption for environmental monitoring. Strengthening collaboration between these communities will improve our understanding of our world during a period of impending climate and extinction crises."
